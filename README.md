Repo for Computer Vision Final Project

The following files are for COMP90081 Project 1.

In order to run the files. Please refer to following:

Computer Vision Final Project 2022.ipynb has all the results. Run this file to observe the experimentation that was done in this project. It requires the following 
- All the .npy files need to be in the same directory as the file 
- disparity_stats.py needs to be in the same directory as the file 
- The image dataset needs to be stored in a folder called "Dataset" in the directory 

Note that the actual running of the experiments is not included in the Computer Vision Final Project 2022.ipynb file. The results of the testing are stored in .npy files. There is a section that demonstrates how it was performed, but due to the long runtimes, they are not included in Computer Vision Final Project 2022.ipynb
